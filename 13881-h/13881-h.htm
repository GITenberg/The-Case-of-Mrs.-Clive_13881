<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<br />

<p>Among other things, the licensing act of 1737 stipulated that Covent
Garden and Drury Lane exclusively were the patented and licensed
theaters (respectively) in London, a fact directly related to the revolt
of prestigious players six years later. Although there were sporadic
performances of &quot;legitimate&quot; drama in unlicensed playhouses between 1737
and 1743, full-time professional actors and actresses were in effect
locked into the approved theaters during the regular theatrical season.
Suspecting a cartel directed against them personally and professionally
by the &quot;Bashas&quot; Rich at Covent Garden and Fleetwood at Drury Lane,<a name="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
the players from Drury Lane in the summer of 1743 banded together and
refused to perform the next season until salaries and playing conditions
improved. Tardy and partial payment of salary was the surface sore
point, unprincipled and unwarranted manipulation by the managers the
underlying one. As the Macklin-Garrick quarrel attests,<a name="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the conflict
was not only between labor and management; but the latter confrontation
is central to the conflict in 1743 and the subject of <i>The Case of Mrs.
Clive Submitted to the Publick</i>, published in October, 1744, by which
time Catherine (Kitty) Clive had established herself as not only first
lady of comedy but also as somewhat of a patriot of the acting
profession and the Drury Lane company.</p>

<p>Coming to Drury Lane in 1728 while still in her teens, Kitty Rafter
(1711-1785) quickly became a favorite of the town by virtue of her
singing voice, vivacity, and gift for mimicry. Admired first as a
singing actress, Miss Rafter in 1731 gave unequivocal notice of her
considerable talent as a comic actress in the role of Nell in Coffey's
<i>The Devil to Pay</i>, one of several hundred she mastered. Her
specialties: Flora in <i>The Wonder</i>, Lady Bab in <i>High Life Below
Stairs</i>, Lappet in <i>The Miser</i>, Catherine in <i>Catherine and Petruchio</i>,
Mrs. Heidelberg in <i>The Clandestine Marriage</i>, and the Fine Lady in
<i>Lethe</i>. Mrs. Clive's (on 4 Oct. 1733, Miss Rafter married George Clive,
a barrister) popularity as comedienne and performer of prologues and
epilogues is indicated by the frequency of her performances and long
tenure at Drury Lane (she retired in 1769) and documented by the
panegyrics of Fielding, Murphy, Churchill, Garrick, Dr. Johnson, Horace
Walpole, Goldsmith, fellow players, contemporary memoir writers, and
audiences who admired her.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Dr. Johnson, I feel, gives the most
balanced, just contemporary appraisal of Mrs. Clive the actress: &quot;What
Clive did best, she did better than Garrick; but could not do half so
many things well; she was a better romp than any I ever saw in
nature.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Part of the half she could not do well were tragedy roles,
attested to by Thomas Davies, who comments on her performances as
Ophelia in <i>Hamlet</i> and Zara in <i>The Mourning Bride</i>: &quot;Of Mrs. Clive's
Ophelia I shall only say, that I regret that the first comic actress in
the world should so far mistake her talents as to attempt it.&quot; And on
Zara, &quot;for her own benefit, the comic Clive put on the royal robes of
Zara: she found them too heavy, and, very wisely, never wore them
afterwards.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Part of the half she could do well is noticed, once
again, by Davies: particularly adroit and distinguished in chambermaid
parts, Mrs. Clive</p>

<blockquote><p>excelled also in characters of caprice and affectation, from the
     high-bred Lady Fanciful to the vulgar Mrs. Heidelberg; in country
     girls, romps, hoydens and dowdies, superannuated beauties, viragos
     and humourists; she had an inimitable talent in ridiculing the
     extravagant action and impertinent consequence of an
     Opera-singer&mdash;of which she gave an excellent specimen in <i>Lethe</i>.
     Her mirth was so genuine that whether it was restrained to the arch
     sneer, and suppressed half-laugh, or extended to the downright
     honest burst of loud laughter, the audience was sure to accompany
     her [my punctuation].<a name="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Clive's stature as a comic actress would, then, seemingly make her
a prize for Rich or Fleetwood, but they did their best to thwart her
career and happiness at their theaters.</p>

<p>I suspect that their motivation in so doing was fear that her temper,
her influence with other actors and her audiences, and her strong
loyalty to her profession would hinder their legislated power to control
absolutely London theaters, players, and audiences in 1743. Not much
investigation is required to see Mrs. Clive at her clamoring best, at
various times head to head with Susannah Cibber, Peg Woffington,
Woodward, Shuter, or Garrick. Her letters to Garrick show that as late
as the sixties she was quite capable of vitriol when she felt that she
or her friends were unjustly treated. Tate Wilkinson was surely correct
in describing her as &quot;a mixture of combustibles; she was passionate,
cross, and vulgar,&quot; often simultaneously.<a name="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> If this were the case in
mere greenroom tiffs or casual correspondence, how the ire of &quot;the
Clive&quot; must have been excited by the cartelists, who did their utmost to
keep her out of joint and almost out of sight.</p>

<p>In 1733, Fielding, who furthered Mrs. Clive's career by writing and
editing parts of his plays for her and publicly praising her as a woman
and as an actress, wrote the following encomium on her professional
integrity in his &quot;Epistle to Mrs. Clive,&quot; prefatory to <i>The Intriguing
Chambermaid</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The part you have maintained in the present dispute between the
     players and the patentees, is so full of honour, that had it been
     in higher life, it would have given you the reputation of the
     greatest heroine of the age. You looked on the cases of Mr.
     Highmore and Mrs. Wilks with compassion, nor could any promises or
     views of interest sway you to desert them; nor have you scrupled
     any fatigue ... to support the cause of those whom you imagine
     injured and distressed; and for this you have been so far from
     endeavouring to exact an exorbitant reward from persons little able
     to afford it, that I have known you to offer to act for nothing,
     rather than the patentees should be injured by the dismission of
     the audience.<a name="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p>Fielding is, of course, referring to the 1733 dispute in which Mrs.
Clive (and Macklin) among the principal players stayed with the
ineffective proprietor of Drury Lane, John Highmore. Jealous that
Highmore and not he gained control of Drury Lane after former
shareholders either died or sold out, Theophilus Cibber demanded, among
other things, that Highmore share profits with his players rather than
pay fixed salaries. He then led the Drury Lane players in revolt in the
autumn of 1733 to the New Haymarket where they played without a license
until March of the 1733-1734 season, at which time they returned to
Drury Lane under the new management of Fleetwood. The actors at least
partially won this battle, and although Highmore tried to have the
vagrant act enforced, the players returned to Drury Lane unscathed. With
Highmore gone, a period of uneasy peace obtained. The players, however,
were not to win so easily the next dispute, the one that took place
after the passage of the licensing act.<a name="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p>Mrs. Clive's decision to stay with Highmore rather than defect was
probably made because &quot;two women&mdash;Mrs. Wilks, the widow of her [Kitty's]
old theatrical idol, and Mrs. Booth&mdash;were in he[* the? her?] direction&quot;
of the theater.<a name="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> But in light of Fielding's words and her actions and
statements in regard to the welfare of Drury Lane and its actors
throughout her career, I believe that Mrs. Clive, although not pleased
with aspects of Highmore's reign, also refused to defect because she
felt that the manager was basically in the right, that her fellow
players would be destitute or at least open to hardship without
employment there, and that the audiences would take offense at such
unprofessional and selfish behavior from their &quot;servants.&quot; The &quot;Town,&quot;
as her own play <i>The Rehearsal</i> (I.i. 159-170) shows, was always her
judge in matters professional.</p>

<p>Fielding's prologue to his revised <i>Author's Farce</i> (1734), spoken by
Mrs. Clive, compares the settled, prosperous former days at Drury Lane
with those of 1734, when &quot;... <i>alas! how alter'd is our Case!/ I view
with Tears this poor deserted Place</i>.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> With few exceptions, the
&quot;place&quot; continued strangely in decline even with a competent company and
often with a full house. The falling-off continued until the advent of
Garrick, who with Lacy in 1747 co-managed the theater into a new era.</p>

<p>From the mid-thirties until 1743, Mrs. Clive appears in roles she had
made famous as well as those newly written with her particular talents
in mind. Fielding, turning more and more to political satire and soon to
another literary form, had little need of her services;<a name="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> but others
did, and the years between the licensing act and 1743 find Mrs. Clive in
demand as the affected lady of quality, speaker of humorous epilogues,
performer in Dublin, and singer of such favorites as &quot;Ellen-a-Roon,&quot;
&quot;The Cuckoo,&quot; and &quot;The Life of a Beau.&quot; This period is also marked by
Mrs. Clive's first professional venture with David Garrick, in his
<i>Lethe</i>, the beginning of a relationship to become one of the most
tempestuous and fruitful in all theater history.</p>

<p>As I intimated at the outset, the licensing act mainly troubled the
London players because of the power of monopoly it invested in Fleetwood
and Rich. Not only were the forums for dramatic presentation now
restricted, but so was professional freedom. The problem, therefore, was
as much philosophical as it was geographical. From the sixteenth century
to 1737, English players had some freedom (albeit limited) to rebel from
intolerable authority and to form their own company.<a name="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> This freedom,
this choice, as Lord Chesterfield pointed out in his speech against the
act, was severely attenuated in 1737, and was to remain so in varying
degrees until the monopoly the act allowed was legislated dead in 1843.
But it was a cartel between the managers that the players most feared,
and there is evidence in the pamphlets growing out of the struggle of
1743 that such a fear was well-founded.</p>

<p>The playing conditions at Drury Lane in the early forties were not good,
a situation directly attributable to the ineptitude and highhandedness
of Fleetwood (and his treasurer Pierson) and his refusal to pay salaries
in full and on time. The manager's accommodating side-show performers in
his company did not help. Macklin, as Fleetwood's lieutenant, had to try
to pacify actors, workmen, creditors; as actor he commiserated with the
players. With the coming of Garrick from Goodman's Fields to Drury Lane
late in the 1741-1742 season and with a progressively disgruntled Clive
all the principals in the revolt are under one&mdash;leaky&mdash;roof.</p>

<p>In light of the number and variety of the published commentary which
accompanied the revolt, perhaps a highlighting of Clive's <i>Case</i> would
be the most efficient way to elucidate some of the major difficulties
involved. After addressing herself to &quot;the Favour of the Publick,&quot; with
encouragement from her friends,<a name="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Mrs. Clive strikes the key note of
her essay: injustice and oppression, specifically seen in the cartel's
threat to &quot;Custom,&quot; an iterative word throughout the essay. Mrs. Clive
first speaks of salary, a matter obviously important to her &quot;Liberty and
Livelihood.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> One writer on the dispute, in a quasi-satirical tract,
denounces the managers in this regard and in so doing echoes Mrs. Clive:
&quot;When there are but two Theatres allowed of, shall the Masters of those
two Houses league together, and oblige the Actors either to take what
Salary or Treatment they graciously vouchsafe to offer them, and to be
parcelled out and confined to this House or t'other, just as they in
their Wisdoms think meet; or else to be banished the Kingdom for a
Livelihood? This is Tyranny with a Vengeance&mdash;but perhaps these generous
noble-spirited Masters may intend their Performers a Compliment in it,
and by thus fixing them to one Place, effectually wipe off that odious
Appellation of Vagabonds, which has been sometimes given them.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> The
licensing act, subsequent cartel, and mistreatment of players were then
not only in the mind of Mrs. Clive. Treated in most of the arguments for
or against the players was salary, but it was only a cover hiding an
underlying malaise.</p>

<p>Implying that the managers set out to ruin certain performers, including
herself, Mrs. Clive accuses them of putting on &quot;a better Face to the
Town&quot; by publishing (inaccurate) salary figures&mdash;a ploy to get public
sanction for lower salaries. Mrs. Clive alludes to salaries published
ostensibly by Fleetwood in the papers (e.g., <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
XIII, October 1743, 553), where the pay of such lights as Garrick,
Macklin, Pritchard, and Clive in the 1742-1743 season is made to seem
higher than the salaries of such worthies as Wilks, Betterton, Cibber,
and Oldfield in the 1708-1709 season. The actors, in presenting their
case (<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, XIII, November 1743, 609), hit at
Fleetwood for citing 1708-1709 salaries, for &quot;the Stage [then] both of
<i>Drury-Lane</i> and the <i>Hay-market</i>, were in so wretched a Condition ...
as not to be worth any body's Acceptance.&quot; The players use instead
salaries of the 1729 players &quot;to place the salaries of the present
Actors in a true light,&quot; since the stage in that year flourished. In
1729, Wilks, the highest paid actor, earned more than his later equal,
Garrick. All other principals' salaries were comparable.</p>

<p>The main complaint of Fleetwood's company, then, was not only base
salary but the &quot;Fallacy&quot; of the manager's account and his &quot;setting down
besides the Manager's Charges, every benefit Night, what is got by the
Actor's own private Interests in Money and Tickets, as also the Article
of 50L for Cloaths, added to the Actresses Account, which is absolutely
an Advantage to the Manager, as they always lay out considerably more.&quot;
This evidence, if not in itself damning to Fleetwood's designs toward
his actors, at least indicates the internecine breach at Drury Lane.
(The inter-theater conflict, important for its effect on repertory and
morale, is adequately examined in theater histories and lies outside my
interests in this essay.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Clive admits, however, that reduced, unpaid, or &quot;handled&quot; salaries
were not the first fear of the actors; it was instead, she says, the
fear of what &quot;would happen from an Agreement supposed to be concluded
betwixt the two Managers, which made 'em apprehend, that if they
submitted to act under such Agreements, they must be absolutely in the
Managers Power.&quot; As the writer of <i>The Case Between the Managers</i> (p.
11) presents it, a conversation between a personified Covent Garden and
Drury Lane would have gone like this: &quot;Well, but, Brother <i>Drury</i>, we
can manage that matter [how to keep audiences]&mdash;Suppose you and I make a
Cartel; for instance, agree for every other Theatre, and oblige
ourselves by this Cartel to reduce by near one half the Salaries of our
principal Performers&mdash;I'gad, we may cramp 'em rarely this way&mdash;they must
serve us at any rate we tax their Merit at, for they'll then have no
where else to go to.&quot; Drury Lane responds, &quot;D&mdash;n me, if that is not
divinely thought&mdash;my dear Friend, give me a Kiss.&quot;</p>

<p>Late in the summer of 1743, several months before the salary figures
described above, Garrick, Macklin, Clive, and Mrs. Pritchard among the
principal players attempted to obtain another license to set up their
own company in the Haymarket: shades of 1733. They applied to the
Chamberlain Grafton&mdash;who denied it, in part perhaps because put out that
Garrick commanded over L500 a year. There was no chance, therefore, to
sidestep the monopoly effected by the licensing act. Leading the
secession, Garrick agreed with his colleagues to stay out until redress
was forthcoming. Redress did not come, the defectors lost, Fleetwood
won. He starved them in not out, Garrick was persuaded to return to
Drury Lane (which he does in early December, 1743) by the entreaties of
several of the destitute seceded players who asked him to accede to
Fleetwood's terms. As Garrick explains to Macklin (see note 2), he did
so because he had the economic welfare of his fellow actors at heart.
Macklin infuriated with him and Clive disappointed in him, both refused
to accept Garrick's decision, and hence became renegade. Macklin,
uninvited back by Fleetwood, admired Olive's decision to have no part in
signing a petition presented to her by her fellow defectors who
understood that the refusal of a separate license dissolved their bond.
Macklin writes in his Reply to <i>Mr. Garrick's Answer</i> (p. 27) that &quot;it
ought to be known that when this Letter was carried to Mrs. Clive, and
her Name to it desired, she had the Honour and Spirit to refuse, upon
any Consideration, to be made so ridiculous a Tool to so base a
Purpose.&quot;</p>

<p>Others were not so generous as Macklin. The author of <i>The Disputes
between the Director of D&mdash;&mdash;y, and the Pit Potentates,</i> one &quot;B.Y.,&quot;
champions the cause of the non-principal players against such as Mrs.
Clive, &quot;for the low-salary'd Players are always at the labouring Oar,
and at constant Expence, while the rest are serv'd up once or twice in a
Week each, as very fine Dishes,&quot; one of whom, he says, is Mrs. Clive, an
&quot;avaritious&quot; person whom he is confident &quot;has found, and feels, her
Error by this Time.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> The writer then details the particular
hardships of Mrs. Roberts, Mrs. Horton, and Mr. Mills, hardships caused
by such greedy principals as Clive. B.Y. obviously chose to ignore the
compassion of Mrs. Clive for the low-salaried players expressed in her
Case.</p>

<p>Evidence that Mrs. Clive was in no position to be avaricious and that a
debilitating cartel in fact existed is found in her own essay. When the
defected players returned to Drury Lane (except Macklin, whom Fleetwood
considered the cause of the theater's troubles) late in 1743, Fleetwood
offered Mrs. Clive a salary incompatible with her talent and lower than
his previous &quot;agreements&quot; with her. Clive says, &quot;They were such as I was
advis'd not to accept, because it was known they were proposed for no
reason but to insult me, and make me seek for better at the other
Theatre; for I knew it had been settled, by some dark Agreement, that
Part of the Actors were to go to Covent-Garden Theatre, and others to
Drury-Lane.&quot;</p>

<p>Led to believe that she would find comfort and acceptance at Covent
Garden based on previous encouragement by Rich to have her join his
company,<a name="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Mrs. Clive realized that the dark agreement was a fact, for
&quot;When I apply'd to him, he offered me exactly the same which I had
refused at the other Theatre.&quot; She managed a bit more salary, however,
and out of necessity agreed to play. More rankling to Mrs. Clive than
basic salary was her being forced to pay for her benefit. The extant
Clive-Garrick correspondence points to the pride she took in not only a
&quot;clear&quot; benefit but one held during that part of the month she dictated.
As is the case with salary, the basis for this complaint was
unreasonable manipulation by the managers, loss of freedom, and an
unjustified break with tradition: &quot;I had had one [a benefit] clear of
all Expence for Nine Years before; an Advantage the first Performers had
been thought to merit for near Thirty Years, and had grown into a
Custom.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Clive did not regularly play for Rich until December 1743, from
which time she &quot;determined to stay there,&quot; doing all in her power to
please her audiences and him. Yet she &quot;found, by his Behaviour to me, it
was designed I should not continue with him.&quot; Clive's specific
exposition of Rich's mistreatment of her is a portrait of an actress
aware of her worth and of a manager at his worst. Fired from Covent
Garden&mdash;against custom and justice&mdash;at the end of the season without
being told, Mrs. Clive could not arrange to play in Ireland, where she
was a great favorite,<a name="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> for Rich's cheat did not become clear to her
until summer was too far advanced. Clive says it all when she observes
&quot;it is unlawful to act any where but with them.&quot; Fleetwood was the only
alternative for the next season, and he still owed her &pound;160. 12s. At the
time of Clive's Case (October, 1744) Fleetwood had not yet contacted her
for engagement at Drury Lane even though he could not &quot;but know I am
disengag'd from the other Theatre.&quot; Nor could have Clive expected much
of a salary from him even if he did call on her since the last season he
offered her &quot;not near half as much as he afterwards agreed to give
another Performer, and less than he then gave to some others in his
Company.&quot; Mrs. Clive could not but conclude that the managers were in
league to distress her.<a name="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> In the final third of her essay, Mrs. Clive
presents a rather touching account of the personal costs of a piece of
legislation which was itself manipulated and &quot;interpreted in the narrow
sense of forming the legal safeguard to the patent monopoly.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p>The &quot;Ladies&quot; who had promised their protection to Mrs. Clive obviously
were influential in convincing Rich to re-hire her, for less than one
month after the appearance of Clive's Case the Prince of Wales and his
Princess sponsored at the Haymarket a concert for her benefit,<a name="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and
her name is regularly listed in the Covent Garden playbills soon after.
The absence of publicity from Mrs. Clive, or about her, suggests that
her second short year at Covent Garden was fairly acceptable to all
concerned, although Portia in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> was hardly her
forte.</p>

<p>The next season finds her back at Drury Lane, where she reigns
uncontested queen of comedy for more than twenty years. In addition to
the return of Clive, the 1745-1746 season (one poor in attendance and
new plays) at Drury Lane is noteworthy because of a reinstated Macklin,
a de-throned Fleetwood, a new manager (Lacy), a well-balanced company
soon to be augmented by player-manager Garrick, prospects for a bright
future&mdash;and a theatrical monopoly stronger than ever.<a name="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> In the latter
regard Mrs. Clive's case is revealing in that it gives a new emphasis to
the epithet His Majesties' Servants.<a name="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

alt="I">n order to put an End to &#383;ome fal&#383;e Reports, which have been rai&#383;ed in
Relation to my not acting this Sea&#383;on, as well as to be&#383;peak the Favour
of the Publick, I have, by the Advice of my Friends, ventured to addre&#383;s
my &#383;elf to them, from whom I have received many and great Marks of
Favour, and who&#383;e further Protection I now &#383;tand in need of.</p>

<p>I know Appeals of this Nature, which relate to Di&#383;putes that happen at a
Theatre, are by &#383;ome thought pre&#383;uming and impertinent, &#383;uppo&#383;ing they
are too trifling to demand Attention: But, as I per&#383;uade my &#383;elf that
Inju&#383;tice and Oppre&#383;&#383;ion are by no means thought Matters of Indifference
by any who have Humanity, I hope I &#383;hall not be thought to take too
great a Liberty. I am the more encouraged to hope this from Experience;
it having been ob&#383;erved, that tho&#383;e Performers, who have had the
Happine&#383;s to plea&#383;e on the Stage, and who never did any thing to offend
the Publick, whenever they have been injured by tho&#383;e who pre&#383;ided over
Theatres, have &#383;eldom, if ever, failed of Redre&#383;s upon repre&#383;enting the
Hard&#383;hips they met with: And, as I at this time, apprehend my &#383;elf to
be greatly oppre&#383;&#383;ed by the Managers of both Theatres, I hope I &#383;hall be
ju&#383;tified in taking this Method of acquainting the Publick with my Ca&#383;e,
&#383;ubmitting it to their Determination.</p>

<p>Before the Di&#383;putes happened betwixt the Manager of <i>Drury-Lane</i> Theatre
and his Actors, I had articled for Five Years to receive Three Hundred
Pounds a Year, tho' another Performer on that Stage received for Seven
Years Five Hundred Guineas, <i>per</i> Year; and at the Expiration of my
Agreements the Manager offered me an additional Salary to continue at
that Theatre.</p>

<p>And &#383;ince I have mentioned tho&#383;e Di&#383;putes, which ended &#383;o greatly to the
Di&#383;advantage of the Actors, I mu&#383;t beg Leave to endeavour to &#383;et that
Matter in a clear Light, which hitherto has been mi&#383;repre&#383;ented to the
Publick: I think my &#383;elf obliged to this, as the Hard&#383;hips I at pre&#383;ent
labour under are owing to that Di&#383;agreement; if any think I treat this
Matter too &#383;eriou&#383;ly, I hope they will remember, that however trifling
&#383;uch Things may appear to them, to me, who am &#383;o much concerned in 'em,
they are of great Importance, &#383;uch as my Liberty and Livelihood depend
on.</p>

<p>As only two Theatres were authori&#383;ed, the Managers thought it was in
their Power to reduce the Incomes of tho&#383;e Performers, who could not
live independant of their Profe&#383;&#383;ion; but in order to make this appear
with a better Face to the Town, it was agreed to complain of the Actors
Salaries being too great, and accordingly a fal&#383;e Account was publi&#383;hed
of them in the daily Papers, by whom I will not &#383;ay: Whether, or no,
&#383;ome particular Salaries were &#383;o, I will not pretend to determine; yet,
in the whole, they did not amount to more than had been allowed for
many Years, when the Theatre was under a frugal and exact Regulation;
when the Managers punctually fulfilled, not only all Engagements to
their Actors, but to every other Per&#383;on concerned in the Theatre, and
rai&#383;ed very con&#383;iderable Fortunes for them&#383;elves.</p>

<p>But &#383;uppo&#383;ing the Expence of the Theatre too high, I am very certain it
was not the Actors refu&#383;ing to &#383;ubmit to a proper Reduction of them,
which made &#383;o many of them quit the Stage, but from great Hard&#383;hips they
underwent, and greater which they feared would happen from an Agreement
&#383;uppo&#383;ed to be concluded betwixt the two Managers, which made 'em
apprehend, that if they &#383;ubmitted to act under &#383;uch Agreements, they
mu&#383;t be ab&#383;olutely in the Managers Power; and the Event has proved that
their Fears were not ill-grounded, as I doubt not but I &#383;hall make
appear.</p>

<p>When the Actors Affairs obliged 'em to return to the Theatres la&#383;t
Winter, under &#383;uch Abatements of their Salaries as hardly afforded the
greater Part of them a Sub&#383;i&#383;tence, I was offered, by the Manager of
<i>Drury-Lane</i> Theatre, &#383;uch Terms as bore no Proportion to what he gave
other Performers, or to tho&#383;e he had offered me at the beginning of the
Sea&#383;on. They were &#383;uch as I was advi&#383;'d not to accept, becau&#383;e it was
known they were propo&#383;ed for no rea&#383;on but to in&#383;ult me, and make me
&#383;eek for better at the other Theatre; for I knew it had been &#383;ettled, by
&#383;ome dark Agreement, that Part of the Actors were to go to
<i>Covent-Garden</i> Theatre, and others to <i>Drury-Lane</i>; I did, indeed,
apprehend I &#383;hould meet with better Terms at <i>Covent-Garden</i>, becau&#383;e
that Manager had made many Overtures to get me into his Company the
preceding Sea&#383;on, and many times before: But when I apply'd to him, he
offered me exactly the &#383;ame which I had refu&#383;ed at the other Theatre,
and which I likewi&#383;e rejected, but was per&#383;uaded to accept &#383;ome very
little better, rather than &#383;eem ob&#383;tinate in not complying as well as
others, and yielded &#383;o far to the Nece&#383;&#383;ity of the Time, as to Act under
a much le&#383;s Salary than &#383;everal other Performers on that Stage, and
&#383;ubmitted to pay a Sum of Money for my Benefit, notwith&#383;tanding I had
had one clear of all Expence for Nine Years before; an Advantage the
fir&#383;t Performers had been thought to merit for near Thirty Years, and
had grown into a Cu&#383;tom.</p>

<p>When I was fixed at that Theatre I determined to &#383;tay there; I did, in
all things which related to my Profe&#383;&#383;on, &#383;ubmit intirely to that
Manager's Direction, and, with the help of other principal Performers,
did greatly promote his Intere&#383;t, as was evident from the Audiences
after we went to Act there; but I found, by his Behaviour to me, it was
de&#383;igned I &#383;hould not continue with him, but return the next Sea&#383;on to
<i>Drury-Lane.</i></p>

<p>The Agreements betwixt that Manager and me were verbal, but made before
two Gentlemen of Character and Fortune, on whom I mu&#383;t depend for the
fulfilling of them; they were for one Year. At the end of the
Acting-&#383;ea&#383;on the Manager &#383;ent an Office-keeper to me with &#383;ome Salary
that was due, who required a Receipt in full; I told him a very great
Part of my Agreements were yet due, and reque&#383;ted to &#383;ee the Manager,
who came and acknowledged them, and promi&#383;ed to bring one of the
Gentlemen who was pre&#383;sent at our Ingagements in a Day or two and pay me,
and then he &#383;aid he had done with me; but he has not paid me, nor have I
ever &#383;een him &#383;ince, or as much as heard from him.</p>

<p>It has always been a Cu&#383;tom in Theatres, that if ever any Actor or
Actre&#383;s was to be di&#383;charged, or their Allowance le&#383;&#383;en'd, they were
acquainted with it at the End of the Sea&#383;on; the Rea&#383;on of this will
appear to be the giving them a proper Notice to provide for them&#383;elves:
This the Manager of <i>Covent-Garden</i> did to all his Company whom he
de&#383;igned to di&#383;charge, or who&#383;e Allowance was to be le&#383;&#383;en'd, except to
me, which made me actually then conclude he determined I &#383;hould
continue with him, 'till I was undeceived by his Play-Bills with the
Names of other Actre&#383;&#383;es in Parts I u&#383;ed to perform; &#383;o that he has not
only broke thro' the Cu&#383;toms of the Theatre, but tho&#383;e in practice
almo&#383;t every where, in di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ing me, and has done me a real Injury in
&#383;uch an unprecedented Act of Inju&#383;tice; for had I been informed of his
De&#383;ign at the End of the Sea&#383;on, I could have made Terms to have acted
in <i>Ireland</i>, where I had met with mo&#383;t uncommon Civilities, and
received very great Advantages, which I &#383;hall ever remember with the
utmo&#383;t Gratitude, and take this and every other Opportunity to
acknowledge.</p>

<p>As I have &#383;aid, it has been a Cu&#383;tom to give Actors Notice of a
Di&#383;charge: I mu&#383;t at the &#383;ame time ob&#383;erve, That it never was a Cu&#383;tom
to di&#383;charge any, but upon Neglect of their Bu&#383;ine&#383;s, or &#383;uch as were
obnoxious to the Publick; this Maxim extended even to tho&#383;e of the
lowe&#383;t Cla&#383;s; but to tho&#383;e, on who&#383;e Performances the Town had been
plea&#383;ed to &#383;tamp a Value, by their Indulgence and Applau&#383;e, the Stage
was always a Support, even after Age or any Accident had made 'em
incapable of their Profe&#383;&#383;ion; for the then Patentees thought it as
great a Piece of In&#383;olence to deprive the Publick of their Plea&#383;ures, as
of Cruelty and Inju&#383;tice to deny tho&#383;e a Sub&#383;i&#383;tence who had contributed
towards 'em; for they knew and acknowledged, that the Publick was the
only Support of all, con&#383;equently had an indi&#383;putable Right to be
plea&#383;ed in the be&#383;t manner po&#383;&#383;ible.</p>

<p>It is pretended by the Managers, that they have the &#383;ame Right to
di&#383;charge an Actor that a Ma&#383;ter has to turn away a Servant, than which
nothing can be more fal&#383;e and ab&#383;urd; for, when a Ma&#383;ter di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;es a
Servant, there are many thou&#383;ands be&#383;ides to apply to; but when the
Managers di&#383;mi&#383;s an Actor, where are they to apply? It is unlawful to
act any where but with them; Nece&#383;&#383;ity or Inclination brings every one
to the Stage; if the former happens to be the Ca&#383;e, they will not
readily find an Employment; and if the latter, they will not be fit for
one; &#383;o that it will appear an Act of great Inju&#383;tice and Oppre&#383;&#383;ion. If
it &#383;hould be objected, That the Actors Demands are &#383;o exorbitant, that
the Managers cannot comply with 'em? I have already endeavoured to &#383;how,
that tho' two or three Salaries might be thought &#383;o in general, they did
not amount to more than had been allowed, and very con&#383;iderable Profits
ari&#383;ing to the Patentees. But there is a very melancholy In&#383;tance, that
the Actors Demands is not the Rea&#383;on of di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ing 'em, but the Will of
the Manager alone; since la&#383;t Sea&#383;on an Actor and Actre&#383;s returned to
<i>Drury-Lane</i> under &#383;uch Abatements as that Manager thought proper, and
&#383;uch as were in no degree equal to their Merit; and yet, at the
beginning of this Sea&#383;on, were di&#383;mi&#383;&#383;ed, after having been from their
Infancy on the Stage, and having no other Profe&#383;&#383;ions to live by, and
very numerous Families to &#383;upport.</p>

<p>The Manager of <i>Drury-Lane</i> tho' he can't but know I am di&#383;engag'd from
the other Theatre, has not made any Application to me to act with him,
which he has done to &#383;everal others who quitted that Stage at the Time I
did: The Rea&#383;ons which obliged me to leave him &#383;till &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;t: He owes
me a Hundred and Sixty Pounds, twelve Shillings, which he has
acknowledged to be ju&#383;tly due, and promi&#383;ed Payment of it by la&#383;t
<i>Chri&#383;tmas</i> to a Per&#383;on of too great Con&#383;equence for me to mention here,
the greater Part of it Money I expended for Cloaths for his U&#383;e. He
offer'd me, la&#383;t Sea&#383;on, not near half as much as he afterwards agreed
to give another Performer, and le&#383;s than he then gave to &#383;ome others in
his Company; &#383;o that I mu&#383;t conclude, as every one knows there are
Agreements betwixt the Managers, that there is a De&#383;ign to di&#383;tre&#383;s me,
and reduce me to &#383;uch Terms as I cannot comply with.</p>

<p>I am &#383;orry I am reduced to &#383;ay any thing in favour of my&#383;elf; but, as I
think I merit as much as another Performer, and the Managers are &#383;o
de&#383;irous to convince me of the contrary, I hope I &#383;hall be excu&#383;ed;
e&#383;pecially when I declare, that at this time, I am not in the lea&#383;t vain
of my Profe&#383;&#383;ion.</p>

<p>As to my Performances, the Audience are the only, proper Judges: But I
may venture to affirm, That my Labour, and Application, have been
greater than any other Performers on the Stage. I have not only acted in
almo&#383;t all the Plays, but in Farces and Mu&#383;ical Entertainments; and very
frequently two Parts in a Night, even to the Prejudice of my Health. I
have been at a very great Expence in Ma&#383;ters for Singing; for which
Article alone, the Managers now give five and &#383;ix Pounds a Week. My
additional Expences, in belonging to the Theatre, amount to upwards of
one Hundred Pounds a Year, in Clothes, and other Nece&#383;&#383;aries; and the
pretended great Salaries, of ten and twelve Pounds a Week, which have
been &#383;o artfully, and fal&#383;ly repre&#383;ented to the Town, to the Prejudice
of the Actors, will, upon Enquiry, appear to be no more than half as
much, &#383;ince they performed half Sea&#383;on, at the Theatres, very &#383;eldom
above three or four Days a Week; &#383;o taking in the long Vacation, when
there are no Plays at all, to tho&#383;e Days the pre&#383;ent Managers omit
acting, a Salary which appears to be great, will be found, in effect, to
be very moderate; and tho&#383;e which are le&#383;s, not a Sufficiency.</p>

<p>I have now fini&#383;hed all I propo&#383;ed; I have &#383;hown in how aggravating a
manner, without any Rea&#383;on a&#383;&#383;igned, and at a Time a very con&#383;iderable
Sum of Money was owing to me, I have been turn'd out of <i>Covent-Garden</i>
Theatre. The Manager of <i>Drury-Lane,</i> tho' he can't but know what ju&#383;t
Rea&#383;ons I had for quitting him, has never apply'd to me to return, nor
made the lea&#383;t Excu&#383;e for not paying my Arrears, tho' due &#383;o long, and
after promi&#383;ing Payment near a Year, notwith&#383;tanding I have, for many
Years, not only endeavour'd, but &#383;ucceeded, in greatly promoting that
Manager's Intere&#383;t, as is known to him&#383;elf and his whole Company.</p>

<p>The Rea&#383;on of my taking the Liberty to communicate the&#383;e Things to the
Publick, is mo&#383;t earne&#383;tly to interceed for their Favour and Protection,
from whom I have always met with great Genero&#383;ity and Indulgence: For,
as I have already declared, in a Letter publi&#383;hed by me la&#383;t Year in the
Daily Papers, that I had not a Fortune to &#383;upport me, independent of my
Profe&#383;&#383;ion, I doubt not but it will appear, I have not made any
con&#383;iderable Acqui&#383;ition to it &#383;ince, having not received two Hundred
Pounds Salary for acting in Plays, Farces, and Singing; tho' other
Performers have received more than twice that Sum. I have, in
Con&#383;ideration of the&#383;e Hard&#383;hips, been promi&#383;ed the Protection of many
Ladies, to whom I have the Honour to be per&#383;onally known, and will not
doubt the Concurrence of the Publick, in receiving my Performance in the
be&#383;t manner I am, at pre&#383;ent, capable of, which I &#383;hall always mo&#383;t
gratefully Acknowledge.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
